    Imputes design vectors by moving from the start or end to change design variables if they are too restrictive:
    For each design variable (from start or end):
    - Create a new design vector only fixing the values up to that design vector
    - Filter out design vectors matching this partial vector
    - If none were found: try to assign different values to the design variable (skipping the current value)
      - If a value is found that matches 1 or more design vectors, stop the search for a different value
    - If exactly one design vector was found to comply: return this as the imputed design vector
